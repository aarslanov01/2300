'''
Write a program to keep track of inventory in a warehouse. 
Your program must keep track of deliveries received to update the quantity of items in the warehouse and the total cost of the inventory in 
the warehouse. Your program must accept deliveries and orders (inputs and outputs) in order to maintain a running balance. 
At any point in the program, the warehouse could be asked for its stock value. It should:

1. Accept incoming orders.

2. Accept outgoing orders.

3. Update the inventory.

4. Provide a total dollar amount of the warehouseâ€™s inventory.
