Write a program to allow a user to order food and beverage from a restaurant. The program should:

Accept the userâ€™s name.

Assume a sales tax of 5% and a gratuity of 20%.

The user may not order less than $50, fewer than 3 items, or fewer than 2 beverages.

The program should continue until the conditions are met
